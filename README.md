### Practice Repo for Kura Learners

Congratulations on completing your first deployment!! Next you will have to make a pipeline script with a Build, Test, and Deployment stage. After you create the script; trigger your build for every 10 minutes. Once you have successfully ran a scheduled job, find a way to schedule your ec2 to shutdown by the end of class. 

- Document the steps it took you to complete this task
- Screenshots at least 2 successful scheduled trigger builds 
- Fork this repo ðŸ‘‰(https://github.com/kura-labs-org/DEPLOY02_CRON_JOB) for the blank Jenkinsfile and make a pull request with:
  1. Documentation
  2. Screenshots
  3. Jenkins pipeline script   

# Good Luck!! :grin:
